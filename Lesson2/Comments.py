#I've been using comments, on the Github in this Repo and when uploaded some of your code.
#In fact, I'm using comments write now. 
#From now on, we should leave comments in our code,
#First of all, comments are ignored by the computer. 
#To make a comment, do what I am doing. Just add a 
#to the start of any line. Python will ignore anything I say. 

#Comments at the start of a program, to give the Author's Name, Program Name, If The Program is Free To Share and Redistribute or if you can't do any of that.
#here is an example:


#Comments.py
#Short Program to show how comments are used in Python. 
#Program Written By: Alexander Parsan
#Under the GPL v3.0

#Comments can also be used during debugging. 
#For example, if you want a line not to run during debugging simply add a # in front of it

#Putting comments before sections help describe it! 
#print "This line will not print"
print "This line will print" #Putting a Comment after a line is a good way to add more info about it. 


#Another Type of Comments
#If you need to remove a large amount of code from your program, I suggest you use Tripe Quoted Strings. These are not an offical way to comment. Some do not think this is a good method, but there is nothing wrong with it!
#Wrap """ around the text you want to comment out

print "This stuff is not commented out"

"""
print "this stuff will not show up
print "yup"
print "9 + 10"
print "HA"
print "Goteem"
"""


#Times to Use Comments
#It is a bad idea to use comments during contests, like the CCC and excessivily in Small programs. 
#Use comments if you need to explain somethng you are doing 
#I personally, will use comments throughout these lessons at the start, and sometimes throughout 
#Comments are perhaps best used for Debugging
#Use them a lot to remove code that you think is causing a problem. 
#You might not need to do this now, but you will later!
