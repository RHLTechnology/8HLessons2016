#Lesson 2
Nice job this week to everyone! Here is the code for most of Lesson 2. Some of you worked on more Lesson 1 work, so take a look at that directory. I've posted some Bonus Work in the 8HLesson2016/Lesson2Bonus Folder so take a look if you want to be ahead. Next we have some more work to finish up with Loops, and then we can get on to writing the first CCC Question and making our first program. Some of you have already approached me with ideas. If you want to be ahead of everyone, email me your program idea, so we can get planning.
