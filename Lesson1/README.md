#Lesson 1
##Intro

Welcome to our Git Repository hosted here on GitHub. For those who don't know what GitHub is, think of it like a Google Drive for Code.Here are some basic python programs you can take a look at. These cover everything we did today, up to the "IF" Statements. Don't worry if you didn't make it up to that point today; not everyone did and we can go over the questions later. Everyone(Feb/23/16) has been able to answer all the questions in the book with a 100% score! I'm very impressed with everyone's work today. If anyone forgets anything, or wants to continue writing programs, this is the place to get the information. Can't wait for next class! 

## About the Code
Inside the folder you will find:

* Print.py - Shows you how to display things to your screen.
* Variables.py - Shows you how to assign variables to Text and Numbers.
* Input.py - Shows you how the user can type in some text or numbers, and have it assigned to a variable and printed out.Not everyone got to this today. 
* Math.py - Shows you all the ways to do Math(Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in Python. Some of this you may not have done 
* If1.py and If2.py - Shows you how IF Statments work. If Statments are basiclly how to compare variables to see if they are true. Not everyone got to this today. IF1.py has a lot of detail, where IF2.py is a very simple program. 
* Calculators/Ryaan.py - To wrap it all the next few files are some basic calculator programs written by some great coders: You guys! These sum up all the concepts learned above! The first one is by Ryaan
* Calculators/Nushaab.py - Here is one by Nushaab.
* README.md - this file you are Reading right now!
