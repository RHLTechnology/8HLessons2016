#This program shows how to variables work
#Remember how a variable works, VariableName, then an equal sign, then what you are assigning to the variable. Variables do not have quotes. Quotes represent strings. 
#For example:

a = 9  #Assigns a value of 9 to the variable a. 
a = 10 #Changes the value a = 9 to equal 10(a = 10)
b = 12 #Assgins a value of 12 to the variable b.
c = a + b #Assigns a value of a + b(or 10 + 12) to the variable c. 

#Does not display "A" or "B" or "C" on the screen. Instead it prints out the values assigned to A,B,C
print a #Will show 10 on the screen
print b #Will show 12 on the screen 
print c #will show 22 on the screen

#Variables can also equal text as well

MyText = "Hello, my name is Alexander Parsan. I am a grade 8 Student at RHL." 

print MyText #Displays "Hello, my name is Alexander Parsan. I am a grade 8 Student at RHL."
