#Here are just a few of the basic mathamatical operations in Python

add = 9 + 10 #Adds9 and 10
subtract = 96 - 42 #Subtracts 42 from 96
multiply = 20 * 20 #Multiplys 20 by 20
divide = 90 /2 #Divides 90 by 2
exponent = 90 ** 3 #90 * 90 * 90

#These can be put together just like in Algebra

MyNumbers = 100 * 5 + 2 / 6 

#You can also add in variables

number = input("Give me a number:")
MyNumbers2 = 200 * number + 2 - number

#There is a lot more Math That Can be done in Python besides all of this, but we will go over those a little later!
