#Lesson2Bonus

Finally time to give some bonus work for you to do. While Bonus Work will not be essential, it will boost your skills. As usual, Review Code for this week is under Lesson2 and code for next week is under Lesson3. In addtion to Bonus Work, I will be putting up Problem's of The Week(Written by both me and the University of Waterloo), for you to solve. I am currently not expecting you to do this, but keep in mind doing this work will help you increase your Tech Team Level. Good Luck!
